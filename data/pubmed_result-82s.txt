Several studies show that a significantly stronger association is obvious between increased body mass index (BMI) and higher breast cancer incidence. Furthermore, obese women are at higher risk of all-cause and breast cancer specific mortality when compared to non-obese women with breast cancer. In this context, increased levels of estrogens due to excessive aromatization activity of the adipose tissue, overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, insulin resistance, hyperactivation of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) pathways, adipocyte-derived adipokines, hypercholesterolemia and excessive oxidative stress contribute to the development of breast cancer in obese women. While higher breast cancer risk with hormone replacement therapy is particularly evident among lean women, in postmenopausal women who are not taking exogenous hormones, general obesity is a significant predictor for breast cancer. Moreover, increased plasma cholesterol leads to accelerated tumor formation and exacerbates their aggressiveness. In contrast to postmenopausal women, premenopausal women with high BMI are inversely associated with breast cancer risk. Nevertheless, life-style of women for breast cancer risk is regulated by avoiding the overweight and a high-fat diet. Estrogen-plus-progestin hormone therapy users for more than 5 years have elevated risks of both invasive ductal and lobular breast cancer. Additionally, these cases are more commonly node-positive and have a higher cancer-related mortality. Collectively, in this chapter, the impacts of obesity-related estrogen, cholesterol, saturated fatty acid, leptin and adiponectin concentrations, aromatase activity, leptin and insulin resistance on breast cancer patients are evaluated. Obesity-related prognostic factors of breast cancer also are discussed at molecular basis.

Colorectal cancer is a major healthcare concern worldwide. Many experimental and clinical studies have been conducted to date to discover agents that help in the prevention of this disease. Chronic inflammation in colonic mucosa and obesity, and its related metabolic abnormalities, are considered to increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Therefore, treatments targeting these factors might be a promising strategy to prevent the development of colorectal cancer. Among a number of functional foods, various phytochemicals, including tea catechins, which have anti-inflammatory and anti-obesity properties, and medicinal agents that ameliorate metabolic disorders, might also be beneficial in the prevention of colorectal cancer. In this review article, we summarize the strategies for preventing colorectal cancer by targeting obesity-related disorders and inflammation through nutraceutical and pharmaceutical approaches, and discuss the mechanisms of several phytochemicals and medicinal drugs used in basic and clinical research, especially focusing on the effects of green tea catechins.

Several meta-analyses of observational studies have been performed to examine the association between general obesity, as measured by body mass index (BMI), and lung cancer. These meta-analyses suggest an inverse relation between high BMI and this cancer. In contrast to general obesity, abdominal obesity appears to play a role in the development of lung cancer. However, the association between abdominal obesity (as measured by waist circumference (WC) (BMI adjusted) and waist to hip ratio (WHR)) and lung cancer is not fully understood due to sparse available evidence regarding this association. PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for studies assessing the association between abdominal obesity and lung cancer up to October 2016. The summary relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with a random-effects model. Six prospective cohort studies with 5827 lung cancer cases among 831,535 participants were included in our meta-analysis. Each 10 cm increase in WC and 0.1 unit increase in WHR were associated with 10% (RR 1.10; 95% CI 1.04, 1.17; I² = 27.7%, p-heterogeneity = 0.198) and 5% (RR 1.05; 95% CI 1.00, 1.11; I² = 25.2%, p-heterogeneity = 0.211) greater risks of lung cancer, respectively. According to smoking status, greater WHR was only positively associated with lung cancer among former smokers (RR 1.11; 95% CI 1.00, 1.23). In contrast, greater WC was associated with increased lung cancer risk among never smokers (RR 1.11; 95% CI 1.00, 1.23), former smokers (RR 1.12; 95% CI 1.03, 1.22) and current smokers (RR 1.16; 95% CI 1.08, 1.25). The summary RRs for highest versus lowest categories of WC and WHR were 1.32 (95% CI 1.13, 1.54; I² = 18.2%, p-heterogeneity = 0.281) and 1.10 (95% CI 1.00, 1.23; I² = 24.2%, p-heterogeneity = 0.211), respectively. In summary, abdominal obesity may play an important role in the development of lung cancer.

Chronic diseases pose a worldwide problem and are only continuing to increase in incidence. Two major factors contributing to the increased incidence in chronic disease are a lack of physical activity and poor diet. As the link between diet and lifestyle and the increased incidence of chronic disease has been well established in the literature, novel preventive, and therapeutic methods should be aimed at naturally derived compounds such as ursolic acid (UA), the focus of this chapter. As chronic diseases, obesity and cancer share the common thread of inflammation and dysregulation of many related pathways, the focus here will be on these two chronic diseases. Significant evidence in the literature supports an important role for natural compounds such as UA in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases like obesity and cancer, and here we have highlighted many of the ways UA has been shown to be a beneficial and versatile phytochemical.

Breast cancer develops over a timeframe of 2-3 decades prior to clinical detection. Given this prolonged latency, it is somewhat unexpected from a biological perspective that obesity has no effect or reduces the risk for breast cancer in premenopausal women yet increases the risk for breast cancer in postmenopausal women. This conundrum is particularly striking in light of the generally negative effects of obesity on breast cancer outcomes, including larger tumor size at diagnosis and poorer prognosis in both pre- and postmenopausal women. This review and analysis identifies factors that may contribute to this apparent conundrum, issues that merit further investigation, and characteristics of preclinical models for breast cancer and obesity that should be considered if animal models are used to deconstruct the conundrum.

Obesity represents a major under-recognized preventable risk factor for cancer development and recurrence, including breast cancer (BC). Healthy diet and correct lifestyle play crucial role for the treatment of obesity and for the prevention of BC. Obesity is significantly prevalent in western countries and it contributes to almost 50% of BC in older women. Mechanisms underlying obesity, such as inflammation and insulin resistance, are also involved in BC development. Fatty acids are among the most extensively studied dietary factors, whose changes appear to be closely related with BC risk. Alterations of specific ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly low basal docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels, appear to be important in increasing cancer risk and its relapse, influencing its progression and prognosis and affecting the response to treatments. On the other hand, DHA supplementation increases the response to anticancer therapies and reduces the undesired side effects of anticancer therapies. Experimental and clinical evidence shows that higher fish consumption or intake of DHA reduces BC cell growth and its relapse risk. Controversy exists on the potential anticancer effects of marine ω-3 PUFAs and especially DHA, and larger clinical trials appear mandatory to clarify these aspects. The present review article is aimed at exploring the capacity of DHA in controlling obesity-related inflammation and in reducing insulin resistance in BC development, progression, and response to therapies.

The huge part of population in developed countries is overweight or obese. Obesity is often determined by body mass index (BMI) but new accurate methods and ratios have recently appeared to measure body fat or fat located in the intestines. Early diagnosis of obesity is crucial since it is considered an increasing colorectal cancer risk factor. On the one hand, colorectal cancer has been strongly associated with lifestyle factors. A diet rich in red and processed meats may increase colorectal cancer risk; however, high-fiber diets (grains, cereals and fruits) have been associated with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer. Other life-style factors associated with obesity that also increase colorectal cancer risk are physical inactivity, smoking and high alcohol intake. Cutting-edge studies reported that high-risk transformation ability of adipose tissue is due to production of different pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-8, IL-6 or IL-2 and other enzymes like lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). Furthermore, oxidative stress produces fatty-acid peroxidation whose metabolites possess very high toxicities and mutagenic properties. 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) is an active compounds that upregulates prostaglandin E2 which is directly associated with high proliferative colorectal cancer. Moreover, 4-HNE deregulates cell proliferation, cell survival, differentiation, autophagy, senescence, apoptosis and necrosis via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PIK3CA)-AKT and protein kinase C pathways. Other product of lipid peroxidation is malondialdehyde (MDA) being able to regulate insulin through WNT-pathway as well as having demonstrated its mutagenic capability. Accumulation of point mutation enables genomic evolution of colorectal cancer described in the model of Fearon and Vogelstein. In this review, we will summarize different determination methods and techniques to assess a truthfully diagnosis and we will explain some of the capabilities that performs adipocytes as the largest endocrine organ.

Obesity incidence has reached pandemic levels, and is accompanied by high incidence and poor prognosis of various types of cancers including gastrointestinal ones. Underlying mechanisms include elevated levels of insulin, IGF-I, and altered adipokine concentration, mainly towards leptin and adiponectin levels. However, it is not yet thoroughly understood. It is now widely known that obesity is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation, characteristic of altered immune cell infiltration in adipose tissue, and changed inflammatory cytokines and chemokines: tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), IL-6, and the chemoattractant monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and others, all together eventually promoting caner pathogenesis. Moreover, accumulating reports have shown that excess adipose tissue in obese individuals resulted in elevated levels of systematic oxidative stress, another way of promoting cancer development and progression. In general, altered immunological milieu and oxidative stress in obesity are important determinants for tumorigenesis.

Linkages between carbohydrates, obesity and cancer continue to demonstrate conflicting results. Evidence suggests inconclusive direct linkages between carbohydrates and specific cancers. Conversely, obesity has been strongly linked to a wide range of cancers. The purpose of the study is to explore linkages between carbohydrate intake and cancer types using a two-step approach. First the study will evaluate the linkages between carbohydrate intake and obesity, potentially stratified by metabolic syndrome status. Second, the estimated attributable fraction of obesity ascribed to carbohydrate intake will be multiplied against obesity attributable fractions for cancer types to give estimated overall attributable fraction for carbohydrate versus cancer type.
We will perform a comprehensive search to identify all possible published and unpublished studies that have assessed risk factors for obesity including dietary carbohydrate intake. Scientific databases, namely PubMed MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBSCOhost and ISI Web of Science will be searched. Following study selection, paper/data acquisition, and data extraction and synthesis, we will appraise the quality of studies and risk of bias, as well as assess heterogeneity. Meta-weighted attributable fractions of obesity due to carbohydrate intake will be estimated after adjusting for other potential confounding factors (eg, physical inactivity, other dietary intake). Furthermore, previously published systematic reviews assessing the cancer-specific risk associated with obesity will also be drawn. These estimates will be linked with the attributability of carbohydrate intake in part 1 to estimate the cancer-specific burden that can be attributed to dietary carbohydrates. This systematic review protocol has been developed according to the 'Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015'.
The current study will be based on published literature and data, and, as such, ethics approval is not required. The final results of this two part systematic review (plus multiplicative calculations) will be published in a relevant international peer-reviewed journal.

Obesity is a worldwide epidemic, with the number of overweight and obese individuals climbing from just over 500 million in 2008 to 1.9 billion in 2014. Type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease have long been associated with the obese state, whereas cancer is quickly emerging as another pathological consequence of this disease. Globally, at least 2.8 million people die each year from being overweight or obese. It is estimated that by 2020 being overweight or obese will surpass the health burden of tobacco consumption. Increase in the body mass index (BMI) in overweight (BMI>25 kg/m(2)) and obese (BMI>30 kg/m(2)) individuals is a result of adipose tissue (AT) expansion, which can lead to fat comprising >50% of the body weight in the morbidly obese. Extensive research over the last several years has painted a very complex picture of AT biology. One clear link between AT expansion and etiology of diseases like T2D and cancer is the development of insulin resistance (IR) and hyperinsulinemia. This review focuses on defining the link between obesity, IR and cancer.

The prevalence of global obesity is increasing. Obesity is associated with general cancer-related morbidity and mortality and is a known risk factor for development of specific cancers. A recent large systematic review of 24 studies based on meta-analysis of 11,149 patients with prostate cancer showed a significant correlation between obesity and the risk of advanced prostate cancer. Further, a sustained reduction in BMI correlates with a decreased risk of developing aggressive disease. On the other hand, the correlation between consuming different products and prostate cancer occurrence/risk is limited.Here, we review the role of adipose tissue from an endocrine perspective and outline the effect of adipokines on cancer metabolism, with particular focus on leptin. Leptin exerts its physiological and pathological effects through modification of intracellular signalling, most notably activating the Janus kinase (JAK) 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 pathway and recently shown sphingolipid pathway. Both high levels of leptin in circulation and leptin receptor mutation are associated with prostate cancer risk in human patients; however, the in vivo mechanistic evidence is less conclusive.Given the complexity of metabolic cancer pathways, it is possible that leptin may have varying effects on prostate cancer at different stages of its development, a point that may be addressed by further epidemiological studies.

Epidemiological studies have reported inconsistent association between obesity and risk of bladder cancer, and the dose-response relationship between them has not been clearly defined.
We carried out a meta-analysis to summarize available evidence from epidemiological studies on this point. Relevant articles were identified by searching the PubMed and Web of Science databases through September 30, 2014. We pooled the relative risks from individual studies using random-effect model, and the dose-response relationship was estimated by using restricted cubic spline model.
Fifteen cohort studies with 38,072 bladder cancer cases among 14,201,500 participants were included. Compared to normal weight, the pooled relative risks and corresponding 95% confidence intervals of bladder cancer were 1.07(1.01-1.14) and 1.10(1.06-1.14) for preobese and obesity, with moderate (I² = 37.6%, P = 0.029) and low (I² = 15.5%, P = 0.241) heterogeneities between studies, respectively. In a dose-response meta-analysis, body mass index (BMI) was associated with bladder cancer risk in a linear fashion (P(non-linearity) = 0.467) and the risk increased by 4.2% for each 5 kg/m2 increase. No significant publication bias was found (P = 0.912 for Begg's test, P = 0.712 for Egger's test).
Findings from this dose-response meta-analysis suggest obesity is associated with linear-increased risk of bladder cancer.

The incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma has increased dramatically in the developed world in the last half century. Over approximately the same period there has been an increase in the prevalence of obesity. Multiple epidemiological studies and meta-analyses have confirmed that obesity, especially abdominal, visceral obesity, is a risk factor for gastro-oesophageal reflux, Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Although visceral obesity enhances gastro-oesophageal reflux, the available data also show that visceral obesity increases the risk of Barrett's oesophagus and adenocarcinoma via reflux-independent mechanisms. Several possible mechanisms could link obesity with the risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma in addition to mechanical effects increasing reflux. These include reduced gastric Helicobacter pylori infection, altered intestinal microbiome, factors related to lifestyle, the metabolic syndrome and associated low-grade inflammation induced by obesity and the secretion of mediators by adipocytes which may directly influence the oesophageal epithelium. Of these adipocyte-derived mediators, increased leptin levels have been independently associated with progression to oesophageal adenocarcinoma and in laboratory studies leptin enhances malignant behaviours in cell lines. Adiponectin is also secreted by adipocytes and levels decline with obesity: decreased serum adiponectin levels are associated with malignant progression in Barrett's oesophagus and experimentally adiponectin exerts anticancer effects in Barrett's cell lines and inhibits growth factor signalling. At present there are no proven chemopreventative interventions that may reduce the incidence of obesity-associated oesophageal cancer: observational studies suggest that the combined use of a statin and aspirin or another cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor is associated with a significantly reduced cancer incidence in patients with Barrett's oesophagus.

Globally, the prevalence of obesity is increasing which subsequently increases the risk of the development of obesity-related chronic diseases. Low-grade chronic inflammation and dysregulated adipose tissue inflammatory mediator/adipokine secretion are well-established in obesity, and these factors increase the risk of developing inflammation-associated cancer. Breast cancer is of particular interest given that increased inflammation within the subcutaneous mammary adipose tissue depot can alter the local tissue inflammatory microenvironment such that it resembles that of obese visceral adipose tissue. Therefore, in obese women with breast cancer, increased inflammatory mediators both locally and systemically can perpetuate inflammation-associated pro-carcinogenic signaling pathways, thereby increasing disease severity. Herein, we discuss some of these inflammation-associated pro-carcinogenic mechanisms of the combined obese breast cancer phenotype and offer evidence that dietary long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may have utility in mitigating the severity of obesity-associated inflammation and breast cancer.

In previous studies, obesity (measured according to the body mass index) has correlated inconsistently with the risk of biopsy-measured prostate cancer, and specifically high-grade prostate cancer. This meta-analysis aimed to clarify these correlations.
A comprehensive literature search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was conducted for relevant studies published through January 2014. The pooled estimates of odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (CI) were computed, and the meta-analysis was performed with the STATA software according to a random effects approach.
A total of 11 studies that included 29,464 individuals were identified. A 5-kg/m2 increase in body mass index was associated with a 15% (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.98-1.34) higher risk of prostate cancer detection and a 37% (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.19-1.57) higher risk of high-grade prostate cancer detection at biopsy. There were no differences among the results of studies conducted in the USA, Europe or Asia. We also found that studies that had adjusted for prostate-specific antigen levels, digital rectal examination results, and prostate volumes obtained positive significant outcomes (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.12-1.44), whereas studies that did not adjust for the above-mentioned confounding variables obtained negative results (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.68-1.25). Moreover, the positive correlation between body mass index and the detection of both prostate cancer and high-grade diseases tended to be stronger as the number of biopsy cores increased.
The present meta-analysis demonstrated that a high body mass index correlated positively with prostate cancer detection, especially high-grade prostate cancer detection. The adoption of a modified and possibly more aggressive biopsy strategy was suggested for obese populations.

Obesity, especially of the abdominal type, is a health problem that constitutes metabolic syndrome and increases the incidence of various diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and cancer. Various mechanisms linking obesity to these associated diseases have been postulated. One candidate is oxidative stress, which has been implicated in vascular complications of diabetes and in pancreatic -cell failure in diabetes. Notably, obese people without diabetes also display elevated levels of systemic oxidative stress. In addition, levels of oxidative stress are increased in the adipose tissue in obese mice. Treating obese mice with antioxidant agents attenuates the development of diabetes. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) occur with lipid accumulation; the addition of free fatty acids elevates ROS generation further. Thus, adipose tissue represents an important source of ROS; ROS may contribute to the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Moreover, the levels of oxidative stress present in several other types of cells or tis-sues, including those in the brain, arterial walls, and tumors, have been implicated in the pathogenesis associated with hypertension, atherosclerosis, and cancer. The increased levels of systemic oxidative stress that occur in obesity may contribute to the obesity-associated development of these diseases.

There is increasing recognition of the impact of being overweight and obese on the development of cancers at diverse sites including the gastrointestinal tract. Large epidemiological studies indicate that up to 14% of tumours may be related to obesity. Pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning this association are not well understood and so are discussed in this review.

The worldwide epidemic of obesity is associated with increasing rates of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Epidemiological studies have reported that these conditions are linked to increased rates of cancer incidence and mortality. Obesity, particularly abdominal obesity, is associated with insulin resistance and the development of dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and ultimately type 2 diabetes. Although many metabolic abnormalities occur with obesity and type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia appear to be central to these conditions and may contribute to dyslipidemia and altered levels of circulating estrogens and androgens. In this review, we will discuss the epidemiological and molecular links between obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cancer, and how hyperinsulinemia and dyslipidemia may contribute to cancer development. We will discuss how these metabolic abnormalities may interact with estrogen signaling in breast cancer growth. Finally, we will discuss the effects of type 2 diabetes medications on cancer risk.

Mounting evidence indicates that obesity may be associated with the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). To conduct a systematic review of prospective studies assessing the association of obesity with the risk of CRC using meta-analysis.
Relevant studies were identified by a search of MEDLINE and EMBASE databases before January 2012, with no restrictions. We also reviewed reference lists from retrieved articles. We included prospective studies that reported relative risk (RR) estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between general obesity [measured using body mass index (BMI)] or central obesity [measured using waist circumference (WC)] and the risk of colorectal, colon, or rectal cancer. Approximately 9, 000, 000 participants from several countries were included in this analysis. 41 studies on general obesity and 13 studies on central obesity were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled RRs of CRC for the obese vs. normal category of BMI were 1.334 (95% CI, 1.253-1.420), and the highest vs. lowest category of WC were 1.455 (95% CI, 1.327-1.596). There was heterogeneity among studies of BMI (P<0.001) but not among studies of WC (P=0.323).
Both of general and central obesity were positively associated with the risk of CRC in this meta-analysis.

Metformin, an oral anti-diabetic drug, is being considered increasingly for treatment and prevention of cancer, obesity as well as for the extension of healthy lifespan. Gradually accumulating discrepancies about its effect on cancer and obesity can be explained by the shortage of randomized clinical trials, differences between control groups (reference points), gender- and age-associated effects and pharmacogenetic factors. Studies of the potential antiaging effects of antidiabetic biguanides, such as metformin, are still experimental for obvious reasons and their results are currently ambiguous. Here we discuss whether the discrepancies in different studies are merely methodological or inherently related to individual differences in responsiveness to the drug.

Obesity is a growing health problem in the United States and, increasingly, around the world. Excess body weight has been linked to an increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer, and growing evidence also suggests that obesity is associated with poor prognosis in women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. Dozens of studies demonstrate that women who are overweight or obese at the time of breast cancer diagnosis are at increased risk of cancer recurrence and death compared with leaner women, and some evidence suggests that women who gain weight after breast cancer diagnosis may also be at increased risk of poor outcomes. In this review, we describe the evidence linking obesity to breast cancer recurrence, discuss the potential biological mechanisms through which weight could impact breast cancer prognosis, and review the weight-loss intervention studies that have been performed in breast cancer populations to date.

Overweight/obesity is an epidemic in the US as well as in other developed countries, affecting two-thirds of Americans and an estimated 2.3 billion people worldwide. Obesity increases the risk for Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. For example, epidemiological studies have established a strong association between obesity and colon cancer. It is generally accepted that metabolic changes associated with overweight/obesity, particularly abdominal obesity and changes in adipocyte function, contribute to the increased risk of colon cancer. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this association is important for the development of preventive strategies for colon cancer. Part of these preventive strategies may be based on dietary factors, such as vitamins, minerals (e.g. selenium), fibre, phytochemicals and phenolic compounds. These anticancer nutrients may counteract the molecular changes associated with obesity. The present article reviews the evidence that inflammation and insulin resistance induced by obesity are the molecular mediators of the association between obesity and colon cancer. We also evaluate the evidence for the ability of dietary factors to target the obesity-induced changes and, thus, protect against colon cancer.

There is increasing evidence of an association between obesity and the development, morbidity and mortality of cancers of the colorectum, (post menopausal) breast, endometrium, kidney, pancreas and oesophagus. In addition to obesity per se, waist circumference is now emerging as a clear indicator of disease risk. Weight gain during adult life also appears to increase risk for breast and colon cancers. Major causative factors which are influenced by excess energy storage include hormones involved in metabolic control (insulin and leptin), cell growth (IGF-I and IGF-binding proteins) and reproduction (steroids and leptin). In addition, raised oestrogens are likely to contribute to the greater risk of breast and endometrial cancers. In cancer survivors, there are also strong indications that being overweight increases the risk for recurrence and reduces the likelihood of survival. Whilst there are no robust data testing the effect of weight loss on recurrence, current guidance highlights that normal weight, overweight and obese patients should avoid weight gain and that a modest weight loss of 5-10% is likely to have significant health benefits. Two studies have now reported long-term effects of obesity surgery on cancer risk (in addition to reducing metabolic disorders and type 2 diabetes). It is becoming increasingly clear that multi-disciplinary groups (including surgeons) are needed to identify, monitor and evaluate programmes for both obesity prevention and management.

Obesity is a growing health problem in developed nations and in countries that are in the process of westernization like India. Obesity is linked with several health disorders such as hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, Type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia and certain cancers. Currently, obesity-related malignancies, e.g., cancers of the breast, prostate and colon are the leading cancers in the industrialized societies. An increased amount of fat or adipose tissue in an overweight or obese person probably influences the development of cancer by releasing several hormone-like factors or adipokines. The majority of adipokines are pro-inflammatory, which promote pathological conditions like insulin resistance and cancer. On the other hand, many recent studies have shown that adiponectin, an anti-inflammatory adipokine, has anti-cancer and insulin-sensitizing effects. Adiponectin exerts its physiological functions chiefly by activation of AMP kinase via adiponectin receptors. Interestingly, several fruits and vegetables may contain adiponectin-like molecules or may increase the biosynthesis of adiponectin in our body. Studies on adiponectin analogues or adiponectin receptor agonists are a promising area of cancer chemoprevention research. In general, fruits and vegetables contain various dietary substances such as vitamins, minerals (like calcium and selenium), fiber and phytochemicals or phenolic compounds (like flavonoids and vanilloids), which may act as anti-cancer agents. Similarly, several dietary constituents including phytochemicals may have anti-obesity effects. Consumption of such dietary compounds along with caloric restriction and physical activity may be helpful in preventing obesity-related cancers. For this review article, we searched PubMed primarily to get the relevant literature.

Obese women are at an increased risk of death from cervical cancer, but the explanation for this is unknown. Through our systematic review, we sought to determine whether obesity is associated with cervical cancer screening and whether this association differs by race. We identified original articles evaluating the relationship between body weight and Papanicolaou (Pap) testing in the United States through electronic (PubMed, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library) and manual searching. We excluded studies in special populations or those not written in English. Two reviewers sequentially extracted study data and independently extracted quality using standardized forms. A total of 4,132 citations yielded 11 relevant studies. Ten studies suggested an inverse association between obesity and cervical cancer screening. Compared to women with a normal BMI, the combined odds ratios (95% CI) for Pap testing were 0.91 (0.80-1.03), 0.81 (0.70-0.93), 0.75 (0.64-0.88), and 0.62 (0.55-0.69) for the overweight and class I, class II, and class III obesity categories, respectively. Three out of four studies that presented the results by race found this held true for white women, but no study found this for black women. In conclusion, obese women are less likely to report being screened for cervical cancer than their lean counterparts, and this does not hold true for black women. Less screening may partly explain the higher cervical cancer mortality seen in obese white women.

Both obesity and Type 2 diabetes are independently associated with an increased risk of developing cancer and an increased mortality. The etiology is yet to be determined but insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia maybe important factors. Hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and inflammatory cytokines in addition to the insulin-like growth factors are also possible factors involved in the process.

The prevalence of overweight (body mass index, BMI, between 25 and 30 kg/m2) and obesity (BMI of 30 kg/m2 or higher) is increasing rapidly worldwide, especially in developing countries and countries undergoing economic transition to a market economy. One consequence of obesity is an increased risk of developing type II diabetes. Overall, there is considerable evidence that overweight and obesity are associated with risk for some of the most common cancers. There is convincing evidence of a positive association between overweight/obesity and risk for adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus and the gastric cardia, colorectal cancer, postmenopausal breast cancer, endometrial cancer and kidney cancer (renal-cell). Premenopausal breast cancer seems to be inversely related to obesity. For all other cancer sites the evidence of an association between overweight/obesity and cancer is inadequate, although there are studies suggesting an increased risk of cancers of the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, thyroid gland and in lymphoid and haematopoietic tissue. Far less is known about the association between diabetes mellitus type I (also called insulin dependent diabetes mellitus or juvenile diabetes), type II diabetes (called non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus or adult onset diabetes mellitus) and cancer risk. The most common type of diabetes mellitus, type II, seems to be associated with liver and pancreas cancer and probably with colorectal cancer. Some studies suggest an association with endometrial and postmenopausal breast cancer. Studies reporting on the association between type I diabetes mellitus, which is relatively rare in most populations and cancer risk are scanty, but suggest a possible association with endometrial cancer. Overweight and obesity, as well as type II diabetes mellitus are largely preventable through changes in lifestyle. The fundamental causes of the obesity epidemic-and consequently the diabetes type II epidemic-are societal, resulting from an environment that promotes sedentary lifestyles and over-consumption of energy. The health consequences and economic costs of the overweight, obesity and type II diabetes epidemics are enormous. Avoiding overweight and obesity, as well as preventing type II diabetes mellitus, is an important purpose to prevent cancer and other diseases. Prevention of obesity and type II diabetes should begin early in life and be based on the life-long health eating and physical activity patterns. Substantial public investments in preventing overweight, obesity and type II diabetes mellitus are both appropriate and necessary in order to have a major impact on their adverse health effects including cancer.

The only universally accepted risk factors for the development of pancreatic cancer are a positive family history or a history of smoking. Although the contribution of pancreatitis to pancreatic carcinogenesis has been debated for decades in the epidemiology literature, the actual mechanism is still unclear. With the rising epidemic of obesity, scientists have begun to focus on the contribution of chronic inflammatory state of morbidly obese patients in an effort to better understand the contribution of inflammation to the comorbidities of obesity. Notably, population studies are beginning to show that one of the most serious potential comorbidities of obesity is an increased lifetime risk of developing cancer. In this article, the current literature that exists supporting this Chronic Inflammatory Hypothesis as it pertains to obesity and pancreatic carcinogenesis is reviewed. To date, studies have focused on interleukin-6, a cytokine known to play a role in obesity, chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. The anti-inflammatory adipocytokine, adiponectin, has also shown promise as a key player in this mechanism and has recently been found to be more specific than standard tumor markers in differentiating pancreatic cancer from chronic pancreatitis. If the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer is related to hormone levels associated with obesity, such as adipocytokines, and cytokines associated with chronic inflammation, this could potentially lead to the development of new pancreatic cancer tumor markers and ultimately new therapies and methods of prevention.

Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most important problems of public health. Among the avoidable risk factors during a woman's life, overweight and obesity are very important ones. Furthermore they are increasing worldwide. The risk of breast cancer is traditionally linked to obesity in postmenopausal women; conversely, it is neutral or even protective in premenopausal women. Since the initiator and promoter factors for BC act over a long time, it seems unlikely that the menopausal transition may have too big an impact on the role of obesity in the magnitude of the risk. We reviewed the literature in an attempt to understand this paradox, with particular attention to the body fat distribution and its impact on insulin resistance. The association of insulin resistance and obesity with BC risk are biologically plausible and consistent. Estradiol (E2) and IGFs act as mitogens in breast cancer cells. They act together and reciprocally. However the clinical and biological methods to assess the impact of insulin resistance are not always accurate. Furthermore insulin resistance is far from being a constant feature in obesity, particularly in premenopausal women; this complicates the analysis and explains the discrepancies in large prospective trials. The most consistent clinical feature to assess risk across epidemiological studies seems to be weight gain during lifetime. Loss of weight is associated with a lower risk for postmenopausal BC compared with weight maintenance. This observation should be an encouragement for women since loss of weight may be an effective strategy for breast cancer risk reduction.

Excess body weight (overweight and obesity) is characterized by chronic hyperinsulinaemia and insulin resistance, and is implicated both in cancer risk and cancer mortality. The list of cancers at increased risk of development in an "obesogenic" environment include common adult cancers such as endometrium, post-menopausal breast, colon and kidney, but also less common malignancies such as leukaemia, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The pathophysiological and biological mechanisms underpinning these associations are only starting to be understood. Insulin resistance is at the heart of many, but there are several other candidate systems including insulin-like growth factors, sex steroids, adipokines, obesity-related inflammatory markers, the nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kappa B) system and oxidative stresses. With such as diversity of obesity-related cancers, it is unlikely that there is a "one system fits all" mechanism. While public health strategies to curb the spread of the obesity epidemic appear ineffective, there is a need to better understand the processes linking obesity and cancer as a pre-requisite to the development of new approaches to the prevention and treatment of obesity-related cancers.

The prevalence of obesity, defined as a BMI of > or =30.0 kg/m2, has increased substantially over previous decades to about 20% in industrialized countries, and a further increase is expected in the future. Epidemiological studies have shown that obesity is a risk factor for: post-menopausal breast cancer; cancers of the endometrium, colon and kidney; malignant adenomas of the oesophagus. Obese subjects have an approximately 1.5-3.5-fold increased risk of developing these cancers compared with normal-weight subjects, and it has been estimated that between 15 and 45% of these cancers can be attributed to overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m2) and obesity in Europe. More recent studies suggest that obesity may also increase the risk of other types of cancer, including pancreatic, hepatic and gallbladder cancer. The underlying mechanisms for the increased cancer risk as a result of obesity are unclear and may vary by cancer site and also depend on the distribution of body fat. Thus, abdominal obesity as defined by waist circumference or waist:hip ratio has been shown to be more strongly related to certain cancer types than obesity as defined by BMI. Possible mechanisms that relate obesity to cancer risk include insulin resistance and resultant chronic hyperinsulinaemia, increased production of insulin-like growth factors or increased bioavailability of steroid hormones. Recent research also suggests that adipose tissue-derived hormones and cytokines (adipokines), such as leptin, adiponectin and inflammatory markers, may reflect mechanisms linked to tumourigenesis.

The literature examining obesity as a barrier to screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer has not been evaluated systematically. With the increasing prevalence of obesity and its impact on cancer incidence and mortality, it is important to determine whether obesity is a barrier to screening so that cancers among women at increased risk because of their body size can be detected early or prevented entirely. On the basis of 32 relevant published studies (10 breast cancer studies, 14 cervical cancer studies, and 8 colorectal cancer studies), the authors reviewed the literature regarding associations between obesity and recommended screening tests for these cancer sites among women in the U.S. The most consistent associations between obesity and screening behavior were observed for cervical cancer. Most studies reported an inverse relation between decreased cervical cancer screening and increasing body size, and several studies reported that the association was more consistent among white women than among black women. For breast cancer, obesity was associated with decreased screening behavior among white women but not among black women. The literature regarding obesity and colorectal cancer screening adherence was mixed, with some studies reporting an inverse effect of body size on screening behavior and others reporting no effect. Overall, the results indicated that obesity most likely is a barrier to screening for breast and cervical cancers, particularly among white women; the evidence for colorectal cancer screening was inconclusive. Thus, efforts to identify barriers and increase screening for breast and cervical cancers may be targeted toward obese women, whereas outreach to all women should remain the objective for colorectal cancer screening programs.

Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of death and illness in developed countries. Previous reviews have suggested that obesity may be associated with 30% to 60% greater risk of colorectal cancer, but little consideration was given to the possible effect of publication bias on the reported association.
Relevant studies were identified through EMBASE and MEDLINE. Studies were included if they had published quantitative estimates of the association between general obesity [defined here as body mass index (BMI) > or = 30 kg/m(2)] and central obesity (measured using waist circumference) and colorectal cancer. Random-effects meta-analyses were done, involving 70,000 cases of incident colorectal cancer from 31 studies, of which 23 were cohort studies and 8 were case-control studies.
After pooling and correcting for publication bias, the estimated relative risk of colorectal cancer was 1.19 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.11-1.29], comparing obese (BMI > or = 30 kg/m(2)) with normal weight (BMI <25 kg/m(2)) people; and 1.45 (95% CI, 1.31-1.61), comparing those with the highest, to the lowest, level of central obesity. After correcting for publication bias, the risk of colorectal cancer was 1.41 (95% CI, 1.30-1.54) in men compared with 1.08 (95% CI, 0.98-1.18) for women (P(heterogeneity) <0.001). There was evidence of a dose-response relationship between BMI and colorectal cancer: for a 2 kg/m(2) increase in BMI, the risk of colorectal cancer increased by 7% (4-10%). For a 2-cm increase in waist circumference, the risk increased by 4% (2-5%).
Obesity has a direct and independent relationship with colorectal cancer, although the strength of the association with general obesity is smaller than previously reported.

The classical view according to which overweight/obesity is related to cancer considers adipose tissue as an active and metabolic "organ", acting through endocrine, autocrine and paracrine processes. Consequently, it has been hypothesized, that genesis and progression of cancer may be caused by different biological factors acting through diverse mechanisms including changes in the synthesis and bioavailability of sex hormones, insulin resistance, release of growth factors and/or proinflammatory cytokines and abnormal energetic disposal and expenditure. We have shown that overweight/obesity can be experimentally induced by benzo[a]pyrene, a universal well characterized chemical pollutant and that overweight/obesity may in fact be caused by several types of chemical pollutants. In this paper we propose that in addition to the above hypothetical biological mechanisms, adipose tissue acts as a reservoir for lipophilic, liposoluble environmental carcinogens, so that chemical pollution may in fact generate both overweight/obesity and cancer. More precisely, we propose that many carcinogens, be they mutagens or promotors can be stored in the adipose tissue, be released at convenient dose in the blood circulation and therefore target peripheral tissues to induce carcinogenesis. Such carcinogens mainly include organochlorine pesticides and PCBs. Their association with an increased risk of cancer seems to be demonstrated for breast and prostate carcinoma, as well as for lymphoma, not only in obese patients, but also in normal weight or even leaner patients suggesting that the adipose tissue may act as a reservoir for environmental carcinogens in obese as well as in non-obese patients.

It has long been known that obesity modestly increases the risk of prostate cancer mortality. Only recently, however, have studies examined whether this association is due to an increased risk of aggressive disease and/or worse outcomes following initial diagnosis and treatment. This distinction is important, because if obesity increases the risk of metastasis and death following treatment, weight loss could be an effective adjunct treatment. We now have good evidence that obesity increases the risk of aggressive prostate cancer, but reduces the risk of low-grade, nonaggressive cancer. In addition, several studies have found that obesity increases the risk of biochemical recurrence following prostatectomy; however, the few studies that have examined more definitive end points, metastases and death, have been less consistent. Furthermore, there are no studies that have examined whether weight loss after diagnosis favorably affects prostate cancer outcome. While accepting the current limitations in our knowledge base, it is our opinion that it is appropriate for physicians to counsel their patients to lose weight following prostate cancer diagnosis and motivate this change in behavior by emphasising the likely benefit of improving long-term outcome.

The skeleton is the most common site of metastasis in patients with advanced prostate cancer. Despite many advances in targeting skeletal metastases, the mechanisms behind the attraction of prostate cancer cells to the bone are not known. Osteoclast cathepsin K, due to its ability to effectively degrade bone matrix collagen I, has been implicated in colonization and growth of prostate tumours in the bone. Identification of new cathepsin K substrates in the bone microenvironment and the recent findings demonstrating its involvement in obesity and inflammation suggest additional roles for this enzyme in skeletal metastases of prostate cancer.

The age-adjusted incidence of colorectal cancer is higher in prosperous industrialized countries than elsewhere. Dietary factors may account for 75% of sporadic colorectal cancer in the west, but the mechanisms remain obscure.
To review evidence for the effects of overweight and obesity, physical activity and specific dietary components on colorectal neoplasia.
English language papers cited on MEDLINE, obtained using search terms related to colorectal cancer, physical activity and body mass and specific food components were reviewed.
There is evidence for adverse effects of overweight and obesity and protective effects of high physical activity against colon, but not for rectal cancer. These effects may reflect metabolic stress and chronic low-grade inflammation. There are also modest adverse effects of red and processed meat. There is evidence for protective effects of dietary fibre, but for fruits and vegetables the evidence remains weak and inconclusive. There is some evidence for protective effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from fish, some micronutrients and possibly phytochemicals. The effects of many dietary constituents may depend upon genetic polymorphisms affecting a variety of genes.
Further research should focus particularly on the effects of insulin-resistance, impaired glucose tolerance and chronic low-grade inflammation on the colonic mucosa.

Increasing prevalence of obesity in many parts of the world emphasizes the importance of learning more about the relationship between obesity and prostate cancer (PC). The present paper reviews the impact of obesity on PC using knowledge obtained from the available literature. Search of published literature in PUBMED database. Adipose tissue constitutes an active endocrine and metabolic organ which may be relevant in the development and progression of PC by different potential mechanisms. Furthermore, obesity could have an impact on the outcome of different treatment modalities for PC, both functionally as anatomically. Obesity is a growing problem, however, the exact role in the development and progression of PC has not been elucidated. Regarding the optimal treatment of PC in obese patients, comparative prospective studies are needed.

Both obesity and prostate cancer (PCa) are epidemic in Western society. Although initial epidemiological data appeared conflicting, recent studies have clarified the association between obesity and PCa. Therefore, we sought to review the epidemiological data linking obesity and PCa with an emphasis on the clinical implications and how to improve outcomes among obese men.
A PubMed search using the keywords "prostate cancer" and "obesity" was performed. Relevant articles and references were reviewed for data on the association between obesity and PCa.
Recent data suggest obesity is associated with reduced risk of nonaggressive disease but increased risk of aggressive disease. This observation may be explained in part by an inherent bias in our ability to detect PCa in obese men (lower PSA values and larger sized prostates, making biopsy less accurate for finding an existent cancer), which ultimately leads to increased risk of cancer recurrence after primary therapy and increased PCa mortality. Despite this detection bias potentially contributing to more aggressive cancers, multiple biological links also exist between obesity and PCa including higher estradiol, insulin, free IGF-1, and leptin levels, and lower free testosterone and adiponectin levels, all of which may promote more aggressive cancers.
The association between obesity and PCa is complex. Emerging data suggest obesity increases the risk of aggressive cancer, while simultaneously decreasing the risk of more indolent disease. This is likely driven by both "biological" and "nonbiological" causes. Simple changes in clinical practice patterns can reduce the impact of nonbiological causes and may help improve PCa outcomes among obese men.

Both obesity and prostate cancer are epidemic in Western society. Although initial epidemiologic data appeared conflicting, recent studies, especially large prospective studies published in the past 6-12 months, have clarified the association between obesity and prostate cancer. The aim of this paper is to review the epidemiologic data linking obesity and prostate cancer, with an emphasis on new data published since 2005. A PubMed search was done on the keywords, "prostate cancer" and "obesity." Relevant articles and their references were reviewed for data on the association between obesity and prostate cancer. Recent data suggest that obesity is associated with reduced risk of nonaggressive disease but increased risk of aggressive disease. This may in part be explained by an inherent bias in our ability to detect prostate cancer in obese men (lower prostate-specific antigen values and larger sized prostates making biopsy less accurate for finding an existing cancer). Ultimately, this leads to increased risk of cancer recurrence after primary therapy and increased risk of prostate cancer mortality. The biologic causes of these associations are likely multifactorial, although the lower testosterone levels among obese men appear to be one of the most promising explanations. The association between obesity and prostate cancer is complex. Emerging data suggest a differential effect of obesity by disease aggressiveness: obesity may reduce the risk of nonaggressive disease while it may promote aggressive disease.

Recent studies demonstrate that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its effector, S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), lie at the crossroads of a nutrient-hormonal signaling network that is involved in specific pathological responses, including obesity, diabetes and cancer. mTOR exists in two complexes: mTOR Complex1, which is rapamycin-sensitive and phosphorylates S6K1 and initiation factor 4E binding proteins (4E-BPs), and mTOR Complex2, which is rapamycin-insensitive and phosphorylates protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt). Both mTOR complexes are stimulated by mitogens, but only mTOR Complex1 is under the control of nutrient and energy inputs. Thus, to orchestrate the control of homeostatic responses, mTOR Complex1 must integrate signals from distinct cues. Here, we review recent findings concerning the regulation and pathophysiology associated with mTOR Complex1 and S6K1.

Many studies have investigated the association between obesity and prostate cancer risk but have yielded inconsistent results. Recent evidence suggests a particular role for obesity in prostate cancer progression. Many studies have investigated the roles of adipose tissue-derived factors (adipokines) as putative molecular mediators between obesity and prostate cancer. This review provides an overview of current evidence that supports such a role for adipokines.
A comprehensive literature review was carried out using PubMed to search for articles relating to prostate cancer and the following adipokines: leptin, interleukin 6, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and adiponectin.
Prostate cancer cells are exposed to adipokines either via the circulation or through locally produced adipokines following invasion of the retropubic fat pad. Circulating levels of most adipokines are positively correlated with obesity; adiponectin is inversely correlated with obesity. High circulating levels of leptin, interleukin 6, and VEGF are associated with increased prostate cancer risk and increased aggressiveness. Adiponectin levels are lower in patients with prostate cancer and are inversely associated with grade of disease. Adipokines exert a variety of biologic effects on prostate cancer cells, modulating cellular differentiation, apoptosis, proliferation, and angiogenesis.
Evidence suggests a role for obesity and adipokines in promoting the progression of established prostate cancer. Adipokines may contribute to the molecular basis for the association between obesity and prostate cancer, but the complex pathophysiology of both these disease states requires further studies.

According to World Health Organisation estimates 1.1 billion people were overweight or obese worldwide in the year 2000 with the prevalence rapidly increasing. Compelling evidence suggests that excess body weight is a risk factor for several cancer types including cancer of the colon, breast, endometrium, kidney, oesophagus, as well as possibly additional sites. According to previous meta-analyses and systematic literature reviews, an important proportion of cancer has been estimated to be attributable to excess body weight. The extrapolation of a European meta-analysis [1] to the Swiss situation broadly estimates that around 700 cancers could be prevented in the absence of overweight and obesity in this country. The data presented highlights the public health relevance of preventing excess body weight. Several interacting metabolic and hormonal pathways seem to underlie the association between being overweight and cancer with insulin-resistance playing a central role. Since evidence is mounting that excess body weight can also adversely affect cancer prognosis, obesity is a primary target for cancer control programs.

Leptin is a multifunctional hormone produced mainly by the adipose tissue and involved in the regulation of food intake and energy balance. In addition, leptin can stimulate mitogenic and angiogenic processes in peripheral organs. Because leptin levels are elevated in obese individuals and excess body weight has been shown to increase breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women, attempts have been made to evaluate whether leptin can promote breast cancer. Data obtained in cell and animal models and analyses of human breast cancer biopsies indeed suggest such an involvement. Furthermore, a recent report clearly shows that targeting leptin signaling may reduce mammary carcinogenesis. Thus, leptin should become a new attractive target in breast cancer.

Obesity is a risk factor for several hormone-related cancers but evidence for an effect on risk of epithelial ovarian cancer remains inconclusive. Many studies evaluating this association have had insufficient statistical power to detect modest effects, particularly for histological subtypes of ovarian cancer. We have therefore assembled the published evidence on obesity and ovarian cancer in a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. We identified eligible studies using Medline and manual review of retrieved references, and included all population-based studies that assessed the association between overweight, body mass index (BMI25-29.9) and obesity (BMI30) and histologically confirmed ovarian cancer. Meta-analysis was restricted to those studies that expressed effect as an odds ratio (OR), risk ratio, or standardised incidence ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI). We identified 28 eligible studies, of which 16 on adult obesity and 9 on obesity in early adulthood were suitable for meta-analysis. Overall, 24 of 28 studies reported a positive association between obesity and ovarian cancer, and in 10 this reached statistical significance. The pooled effect estimate for adult obesity was 1.3 (95%CI1.1-1.5) with a smaller increased risk for overweight (OR1.2;95%CI1.0-1.3). The pooled OR was stronger among case-control studies (OR=1.5) than cohort studies (OR=1.1). Overweight/obesity in early adulthood was also associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. There was no evidence that the association varied for the different histological subtypes of ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer should be added to the list of cancers likely to be related to obesity.

Obesity has a complicated relationship to both breast cancer risk and the clinical behaviour of the established disease. It is suggested that obesity is associated with both an increased risk of developing breast cancer risk and worse prognosis after disease onset. In post-menopausal women, various measures of obesity such as body mass index, weight, weight gain and waist : hip ratio have all been positively associated with risk of developing breast cancer. In most but not all case-control and prospective cohort studies, an inverse relationship has been found between weight and breast cancer among pre-menopausal women. Some data suggest that adult weight gain and central obesity increase the risk of pre-menopausal breast cancer. Obesity at the time of diagnosis is thought to be significant as a poor prognostic factor. Obesity is associated with adverse outcomes in both pre- and post-menopausal women with breast cancer. Many cancer survivors seek ways to minimize the risk of recurrence and death because of breast cancer. Despite complex and at times controversial data, enough evidence is available at present to suggest that weight management should be a part of the strategy to prevent the occurrence, recurrence and death because of breast cancer. In this review the effect of obesity on the prognosis of breast cancer is examined in detail.

Accumulating epidemiological evidence shows that being either overweight or obese, in other words having excess body weight (EBW), is associated with an increased risk of several, common, adult cancers. The molecular mechanisms that underlie these associations are not understood fully, but insulin resistance is likely to be important. The insulin-cancer hypothesis postulates that chronic hyperinsulinemia is associated with decreased concentrations of insulin-like growth factor binding protein1 (IGFBP-1) and IGFBP-2, leading to increased availability of IGF-I and concomitant changes in the cellular environment that favor tumor formation. However, the situation is likely to be more complex because hyperinsulinemia is also associated with alterations in related molecular systems (e.g. sex steroids and adipocytokines). As the prevalence of EBW increases to epidemic proportions, untangling the links between EBW and the insulin-IGF axis and its wider molecular interactions will become increasingly important in the development of preventive strategies.

The evidence that obesity adversely affects women's health is overwhelming and indisputable. The risk of postmenopausal breast cancer increases with obesity; measured as weight gain, body mass index, waist-hip ratio or percent body fat. It is also established that obesity is associated with poor prognosis of breast cancer. This review examines in detail the possible mechanisms by which obesity causes poor prognosis of breast cancer such as estrogenic activity, advanced or more aggressive disease at diagnosis and high likelihood of both local and systemic treatment failure. After careful consideration of the available evidence, the author concludes that obesity contributes towards development and poor prognosis of breast cancer; therefore, weight management should be an integral part of any strategy to prevent and improve the outcome of breast cancer.

Breast cancer continues to be a major health problem for women in the USA and worldwide. There is a need to identify and take steps to alter modifiable breast cancer risks. Conditions of obesity and overweight are risk factors that have reached epidemic proportions. This article reviews the evidence in the literature that test mechanism-based hypotheses which attempt to provide a molecular basis for a causal link between obesity and breast cancer risk, particularly the effects of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance, peripheral estrogen aromatization in adipose tissue, and direct effect of adipokines. Future areas for study and implications for therapy are discussed.

The relationship between obesity and prostate cancer is currently a hotly debated topic, but despite the number of publications devoted to the topic, the actual nature of the relationship remains uncertain. Obesity has been shown to have a direct relationship with the incidence of prostate cancer in a number of studies but an equal number of studies have shown no association. The relationship is further obscured with recent findings that obesity in younger obese men may actually be protective against prostate cancer. Confounding factors include the lack of correlation of body mass index (BMI) as a measure of central obesity and the lack of consistency in timing of BMI measurements, i.e. before or after diagnosis and in young or advanced adulthood. Evidence for increased BMI as a risk factor for prostate cancer is unclear, but less ambiguous is the mounting substantiation that obesity is associated with prognostically worse disease, poorer post-surgical outcomes and increased prostate cancer mortality, irregardless of margin status. From a biologic perspective, one can put forth a number of potential mechanisms by which obesity might promote prostate cancer and/or prostate cancer progression including; low levels of testosterone, increased levels of estrogen, co-existing diabetes or metabolic syndrome, increased circulating insulin-growth factor-one (IGF-1), increased levels of leptin, decreased levels of adiponectin and increased dietary saturated fats. Evidence for the association of these factors with prostate cancer are examined herein. The timing of serum measurements is crucial in elucidating whether these factors have causative influence on prostate cancer or rather are produced by the prostate cancer cells and are better understood as markers of disease. The interaction between obesity and prostate cancer is important to clarify because it will have impact on the prevention, prognostication and treatment of prostate cancer. Future study with careful attention to avoid the methodological pitfalls of the past need be accomplished to bear out the nature of the interaction of obesity and prostate cancer.

Prostate cancer, the third most common cancer in men worldwide, varies substantially according to geographic region and race/ethnicity. Obesity and associated endocrine variation are foremost among the risk factors that may underlie these regional and ethnic differences. The association between obesity and prostate cancer incidence is complex and has yielded inconsistent results. Studies that have linked obesity with prostate cancer mortality, advanced stage disease, and higher grade Gleason score, however, have produced more consistent findings, indicating that obesity may not necessarily increase the risk of prostate cancer, but may promote it once established. Additionally, metabolic syndrome, which includes disturbed glucose metabolism and insulin bioactivity, may also be associated with prostate carcinogenesis. Adipokines, defined as biologically active polypeptides produced by adipose tissue, have been linked with a number of carcinogenic mechanisms, including angiogenesis, cell proliferation, metastasis, and alterations in sex-steroid hormone levels. A number of emerging studies have implicated the role of adipokines in prostate carcinogenesis. This review explores the specific roles of several adipokines as putative mediating factors between obesity and prostate cancer with particular attention to leptin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and adiponectin.

There is increasing evidence that dysregulation of energy homeostasis is associated with colorectal carcinogenesis. Epidemiological data have consistently demonstrated a positive relation between increased body size and colorectal malignancy, whereas mechanistic studies have sought to uncover obesity-related carcinogenic pathways. The phenomenon of "insulin resistance" or the impaired ability to normalize plasma glucose levels has formed the core of these pathways, but other mechanisms have also been advanced. Obesity-induced insulin resistance leads to elevated levels of plasma insulin, glucose and fatty acids. Exposure of the colonocyte to heightened concentrations of insulin may induce a mitogenic effect within these cells, whereas exposure to glucose and fatty acids may induce metabolic perturbations, alterations in cell signaling pathways and oxidative stress. The importance of chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of obesity has recently been highlighted and may represent an additional mechanism linking increased adiposity to colorectal carcinogenesis. This review provides an overview of the epidemiology of body size and colorectal neoplasia and outlines current knowledge of putative mechanisms advanced to explain this relation. Family based studies have shown that the propensity to become obese is heritable, but this is only manifest in conditions of excess energy intake over expenditure. Inheritance of a genetic profile that predisposes to increased body size may also be predictive of colorectal cancer. Genomewide scans, linkage studies and candidate gene investigations have highlighted more than 400 chromosomal regions that may harbor variants that predispose to increased body size. The genetics underlying the pathogenesis of obesity are likely to be complex, but variants in a range of different genes have already been associated with increased body size and insulin resistance. These include genes encoding elements of insulin signaling, adipocyte metabolism and differentiation, and regulation of energy expenditure. A number of investigators have begun to study genetic variants within these pathways in relation to colorectal neoplasia, but at present data remain limited to a handful of studies. These pathways will be discussed with particular reference to genetic polymorphisms that have been associated with obesity and insulin resistance.

Recent studies on the association between obesity and prostate cancer appear to be in conflict. A recent prospective cohort study reported that the incidence of prostate cancer was lower among obese men under the age of 60 years and among those men with a family history of prostate cancer. Similarly, a case-control study found obesity was inversely associated with prostate cancer risk in men aged 40-64 years. However, several prospective cohort studies found that obese men are more likely to die from prostate cancer than non-obese men. Finally, two recent studies found that among men with prostate cancer, obese men were more likely to have a biochemical progression after surgery. We postulate that by closely examining the comparison groups used in these studies, these findings may, in fact, be in agreement. Specifically, this paradox within the literature may result from the possibility that obesity influences the development of aggressive (i.e., higher stage, higher grade, recurrence, death) and non-aggressive disease differently. We suggest that obesity may reduce the risk of non-aggressive disease but simultaneously increase the risk of aggressive disease. Finally, additional methodological issues are discussed that investigators need to be aware of to be able to draw inferences across studies of obesity and prostate cancer outcomes.

Obesity-associated prostate cancer (PCa) remains controversial, although most studies rely on body mass index evaluation, which is an indirect measure of fatness. Studies using body fat measurement and disease stratification according to PCa stage found stronger associations between obesity and PCa. Leptin is a pleiotrophic hormone mainly synthesized by adipocytes that acts in peripheral organs such as the prostate. This article reviews obesity-associated leptin's pathophysiological role in PCa progression. PCa development results from some known risk factors. Currently, there is enough evidence suggesting that leptin is an additional factor involved in advanced PCa occurrence, and obesity association with high-grade disease. Life-long exposure to genetic and/or environmental susceptibility factors that predispose to obesity and higher leptin levels may increase the risk for advanced PCa.

Obesity is a risk factor for many diseases. Thirty per cent of Americans are viewed as super obese; therefore, we need to find a solution. We already know about the diseases associated with obesity such as high blood pressure, diabetes, sleep apnoea, etc. Lately, there has been an increased interest in understanding if cancer is related to obesity. In this paper, we review the incidence of colon cancer and obesity. Insulin is the best established biochemical mediator between obesity and colon cancer. Hyperinsulinaemia, such as occurs in type II diabetes, is important in the pathogenesis of colon cancer. All adipose tissue is not equal. Visceral abdominal fat has been identified as the essential fat depot for pathogenetic theories that relate obesity and colon cancer. The genders differ as regards to how the relationship between obesity and colon cancer has been evaluated. Obesity imposes a greater risk of colon cancer for men of all ages and for premenopausal women than it does for postmenopausal women. Regular exercise reduces the risk of developing colon cancer and the risk of death from colon cancer should it develop. We believe that a combination of waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI) measurements is recommended to assess the obesity related risk of developing colon cancer. Radiographic assessments of visceral abdominal fat may eventually prove to be the best means of assessing a patient's obesity related risk of developing colon cancer. Although WC is better established as a measure of obesity than BMI, the evidence for colon cancer risk is not secure on this point; combining BMI and WC measurements would appear, at present, to be the wisest approach for colon cancer risk assessment. Doctors who wish to decrease their patients' risk of dying of colon cancer should advise weight loss and exercise. Conversely, physicians and public health authorities should consider both exercise and obesity when designing colon cancer screening protocols. Morphometric cut offs should be adjusted, if possible, for age, sex, ethnicity, and height.

Obesity is a known cause of metabolic syndrome which includes Type II diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. It is well documented that insulin resistance contributes to the mortality and the incidence of metabolic syndromes including central obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia and hypertension. Both obesity and diabetes are emerging topics for researchers to consider as having a possible causal association with cancer since the two factors have been viewed as risk factors for cancer. The present paper introduced the hypothesis of a possible causal relationship between obesity, insulin resistance and cancer and reviews relevant existing studies in this area. More efforts and studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms and the common risk factors which might be incorporated into interventions to prevent cancer and cardiovascular diseases as top causes of death.

Overweight and obesity increase the risk of developing several cancers. Once cancer develops, individuals may be at increased risk of recurrence and poorer survival if they are overweight or obese. A statistically significant association between overweight or obesity and breast cancer recurrence or survival has been observed in the majority of population-based case series; however, adiposity has been shown to have less of an effect on prognosis in the clinical trial setting. Weight gain after breast cancer diagnosis may also be associated with decreased prognosis. New evidence suggests that overweight/obesity vs normal weight may increase the risk of poor prognosis among resected colon cancer patients and the risk of chemical recurrence inprostate cancer patients. Furthermore, obese cancer patients are at increased risk for developing problems following surgery, including wound complication, lymphedema, second cancers, and the chronic diseases affecting obese individuals without cancer such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Mechanisms proposed to explain the association between obesity and reduced prognosis include adipose tissue-induced increased concentrations of estrogens and testosterone, insulin, bioavailable insulin-like growth factors, leptin, and cytokines. Additional proposed mechanisms include reduced immune functioning, chemotherapy dosing, and differences in diet and physical activity in obese and nonobese patients. There have been no randomized clinical trials testing the effect of weight loss on recurrence or survival in overweight or obese cancer patients, however. In the absence of clinical trial data, normal weight, overweight, and obese patients should be advised to avoid weight gain through the cancer treatment process. In addition, weight loss is probably safe, and perhaps helpful, for overweight and obese cancer survivors who are otherwise healthy.

It has been suggested that obesity and fatty liver may be associated with the morbidity and mortality of liver cancer, and the early diagnosis and effective treatment of fatty liver coupled with liver cancer are supposed to improve the prognosis of obese patients.

Obesity is associated with the risk of death from all cancers and from cancers at individual sites including liver cancer, and it is an independent risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and cryptogenic cirrhosis. Because nonalcoholic steatohepatitis has been implicated as a major cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis, the development of HCC may be part of progressive nature of this condition.
Obesity is associated with the incidence and mortality of HCC. More frequent surveillance for HCC may be warranted in obese patients with fatty liver and attempts should be made to interrupt the progression from simple hepatic steatosis to steatohepatitis, cirrhosis and ultimately HCC.

In the climacteric, about 40% of the women have occult breast tumors the growth of which may be stimulated by hormones. Many genetic, reproductive and lifestyle factors may influence the incidence of breast cancer. Epidemiological data suggest that the increase in the relative risk (RR) of breast cancer induced by hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is comparable with that associated with early menarche, late menopause, late first birth, alcohol consumption, etc. One of the most important risk factors is obesity which exceeds the effect of HRT by far, and in overweight postmenopausal women the elevated risk of breast cancer is not further increased by HRT. As in the WHI study the majority of women was overweight or obese, this trial was unsuitable for the investigation of breast cancer risk. In the women treated with an estrogen/progestin combination, the RR of breast cancer rose only in those women who have been treated with hormones prior to the study, suggesting a selection bias. In the women not pretreated with hormones, it was not elevated. In the estrogen-only arm of the WHI study, there was no increase but a steady decrease in the RR of breast cancer during 6.8 years of estrogen therapy. This result was unexpected, as estrogens are known to facilitate the development and growth of breast tumors, and the effect is enhanced by the addition of progestins. Obese women are at high risk to develop a metabolic syndrome including insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. In postmenopausal women, elevated insulin levels are not only associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, but also for breast cancer. This might explain the effects observed in both arms of the WHI study: HRT with relative low doses of estrogens may improve insulin resistance and, hence, reduce the elevated breast cancer risk in obese patients, whereas this beneficial estrogen effect may be antagonized by progestins. The principal options for the reduction of breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women are the prevention of overweight and obesity to avoid the development of hyperinsulinemia, the medical treatment of insulin resistance, the use of low doses of estrogens and the reduction of exposure to progestins. The latter might include long-cycles with the sequential use of appropriate progestins every 3 months for 14 days. There are large inter-individual variations in the proliferative response to estrogens of the endometrium. Control by vaginalsonography and progestin challenge tests may help to identify those women who may be candidates for low-dose estrogen-only therapy.

This review examines the relationship between obesity and prostate cancer, with an update of recent research in this field.
A recent report of the Cancer Prevention Study II showed a direct relationship between increasing body mass index and prostate cancer mortality. However, the US Health Professionals Followup Study reported an inverse association between obesity and the risk of developing prostate cancer in men under 60 years of age or in those with a family history of prostate cancer. These studies illustrate the contradictory evidence linking obesity to prostate cancer risk and mortality. Body mass does not appear to affect the performance of prostate-specific antigen as a diagnostic test, and on prostate biopsy a lower body mass is associated with a higher cancer detection rate and a higher cancer volume as measured by core length involvement. In two recent radical prostatectomy series, obesity was associated with worse pathological features and higher biochemical recurrence rates. The higher risk of recurrence persisted in patients with organ-confined disease and negative surgical margins, implying that this risk is not related to surgical technique. Several potential biological mechanisms have been proposed to explain this link including hormonal alterations, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, and elevated insulin-like growth factor and leptin levels.
Recent literature provides evidence that obesity may promote the development of a more aggressive form of prostate cancer, resulting in higher recurrence rates after primary therapy and higher cancer mortality rates overall. The mechanism to explain the association between obesity and prostate cancer is unclear.

This review provides an update on research into the association between obesity and prostate cancer.
The US Health Professional Study reported an inverse relationship between risk for prostate cancer and obesity in men under the age of 60 or in those with a positive family history for prostate cancer. Others found no association between obesity and risk for the disease. Regarding detection, obesity does not impact upon measurement of prostate specific antigen as a method of detecting prostate cancer; however, in a referral population there was an inverse association between detection rate and obesity. In three radical prostatectomy series, obesity was associated with worse pathological features and higher biochemical relapse rates. Possible mechanisms for the association between obesity and prostate cancer include the impact on serum testosterone, leptin, insulin-like growth factor I, and interleukin-6 levels.
A growing body of evidence suggests that obesity may impact upon risk, detection and outcome with regard to prostate cancer.

Gastrointestinal malignancies may be associated with obesity, defined specifically by increased body-mass index, and based largely on environmental factors rather than genetics. In particular, there seems to be a definite increase in the incidence of both oesophageal and colorectal cancer. Mechanisms associated with obesity include a particular metabolic state characterized by hyperinsulinemia, or insulin resistance, along with elevated serum leptin. Leptin is derived from adipocytes and appears to play a role in the regulation of ghrelin, a peptide derived from the stomach and small intestine that stimulates appetite and weight gain. In addition to these metabolic changes, there are other anatomical alterations that may indirectly predispose to cancer, including the predisposition of obesity to gastroesophageal reflux and, possibly, oesophageal cancer. Other mechanisms may involve adipocyte-derived cytokines, or adipokines, that may serve as signalling devices in the pathogenesis of cancer. Finally, pharmacologic and surgical avenues available for treatment of obesity, including lipase inhibitors and gastric or jejuno-ileal bypass procedures may set the stage for subsequent gastric or intestinal tract cancer.

A presentation on osteoporosis, obesity and obesity related disease at the Conference on Innovations and Challenges in Prostate Cancer: Prevention, Detection and Treatment is summarized.
A focused literature review was done.
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists decrease bone mineral density and increase fracture risk. GnRH agonists also increase weight and fat mass, and decrease lean body mass. Treatment related changes in body composition may contribute to fatigue and fracture risk. The phenotype of men with GnRH agonist shares some features with the insulin resistance syndrome, raising the possibility that GnRH may also increase the risk of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.
The routine use of GnRH agonists in men with long life expectancy increases the importance of understanding and preventing the unintended adverse effects of treatment. Some adverse effects have the potential to impact not only quality of life, but also noncancer mortality. Additional research is needed to characterize better the unintended effects of androgen deprivation therapy and develop optimal strategies to prevent osteoporosis, obesity and obesity related disease.

Large prospective studies show a significant association with obesity for several cancers, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified the evidence of a causal link as 'sufficient' for cancers of the colon, female breast (postmenopausal), endometrium, kidney (renal cell), and esophagus (adenocarcinoma). These data, and the rising worldwide trend in obesity, suggest that overeating may be the largest avoidable cause of cancer in nonsmokers. Few obese people are successful in long-term weight reduction, and thus there is little direct evidence regarding the impact of weight reduction on cancer risk. If the correlation between obesity and cancer mortality is entirely causal, we estimate that overweight and obesity now account for one in seven of cancer deaths in men and one in five in women in the US.

The adipocytokines are biologically active polypeptides that are produced either exclusively or substantially by the adipocytes, and act by endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine mechanisms. Most have been associated with obesity, hyperinsulinaemia, type 2 diabetes, and chronic vascular disease; in addition, six adipocytokines--vascular endothelial growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, leptin, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor, and interleukin-6--promote angiogenesis while one, adiponectin, is inhibitory. Obesity and insulin resistance have both been identified as risk factors for breast cancer and are associated with late-stage disease and poor prognosis. Angiogenesis is essential for breast cancer development and progression, and so it is plausible that obesity-related increases in adipocytokine production and a reduction in adiponectin may adversely affect breast cancer outcome by their angiogenesis-related activities. There is also experimental evidence that some adipocytokines can act directly on breast cancer cells to stimulate their proliferation and invasive capacity. Thus, adipocytokines may provide a biological mechanism by which obesity and insulin resistance are causally associated with breast cancer risk and poor prognosis. Both experimental and clinical studies are needed to develop this concept, and particularly in oestrogen-independent breast cancers where preventive and therapeutic options are limited.

A woman's build, the risk of breast cancer and its subsequent prognosis seem to be related. In most but not all case-control and prospective cohort studies, an inverse relationship has been found between weight and breast cancer among premenopausal women. However, most large epidemiological studies have found that overweight or obese women are at increased risk of developing postmenopausal breast cancer. It is suggested that higher body mass index is associated with a more advanced stage of breast cancer at diagnosis in terms of tumour size but data on lymph node status is not so consistent. All treatment modalities for breast cancer such as surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormonal treatment may be adversely affected by the presence of obesity. The overall and disease-free survival is worse in most but not all studies of prognosis of obese pre- and postmenopausal women with breast cancer.

The specific effect of central rather than general obesity on breast cancer risk is not clear. This review examines the relationship between waist and waist-hip ratio (WHR) and risk of breast cancer in pre- and post-menopausal women using all available cohort and case-control data. The databases of the Cochrane Library, Medline, Cancer Lit and Embase were searched until October 2002. Relevant cohort and case-control studies with separate analyses in pre- and/or post-menopausal women were included. Random effects meta-analyses were carried out, subgrouped by pre- or post-menopausal status and cohort or case-control design. Sensitivity analyses were also performed. Five cohort studies with 72,1705 person years of observation (453 pre-menopausal and 2684 post-menopausal cases), and three case-control studies comprising 276 pre-menopausal cases with 758 pre-menopausal controls and 390 post-menopausal cases with 1071 post-menopausal controls were included. Pooled results from cohort studies using the most adjusted data [but without adjustment for weight or body mass index (BMI)] suggest a 39% lower risk of breast cancer in post-menopausal women with the smallest waist (compared with the largest) and a 24% lower risk in women with the smallest WHR. In pre-menopausal women, however, pooled results suggest that measurement of waist or WHR have little effect on risk of breast cancer. Adjustment for BMI abolished the relationship between waist or WHR and risk of post-menopausal breast cancer, but introduced such a relationship amongst pre-menopausal women. The relationship between a smaller measurement of waist or WHR and lower risk of post-menopausal breast cancer appears to result from the associated correlation with BMI. Amongst pre-menopausal women, central (not general) obesity may be specifically associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.

Obesity has a complicated relationship to both breast cancer risk and the clinical behavior of the established disease. In postmenopausal women, particularly the elderly, various measures of obesity have been positively associated with risk. However, before menopause increased body weight is inversely related to breast cancer risk. In both premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer, the mechanisms by which body weight and obesity affect risk have been related to estrogenic activity. Obesity has also been related to advanced disease at diagnosis and with a poor prognosis in both premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer. Breast cancer in African-American women, considering its relationship to obesity, exhibits some important differences from those described in white women, although the high prevalence of obesity in African-American women may contribute to the relatively poor prognosis compared with white American women. Despite the emphasis on estrogens to explain the effects of obesity on breast cancer, other factors may prove to be equally or more important, particularly as they relate to expression of an aggressive tumor phenotype. Among these, this review serves to stress insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I, and leptin, and their relationship to angiogenesis, and transcriptional factors.

Obesity is an established risk factor for postmenopausal, but not premenopausal, development of breast cancer. Evidence for a positive association between obesity and breast cancer mortality is mounting. Avoiding adult weight gain and maintaining a healthy body weight may contribute importantly to decreasing breast cancer risk and mortality, especially in postmenopausal women.

Endometrial cancer is a disease of the affluent, developed world, where epidemiological studies have shown that > or =40% of its incidence can be attributed to excess body weight. An additional proportion may be because of lack of physical activity. Alterations in endogenous hormone metabolism may provide the main links between endometrial cancer risk, and excess body weight and physical inactivity. Epidemiological studies have shown increased endometrial cancer risks among pre- and postmenopausal women who have elevated plasma androstenedione and testosterone, and among postmenopausal women who have increased levels of estrone and estradiol. Furthermore, there is evidence that chronic hyperinsulinemia is a risk factor. These relationships can all be interpreted in the light of the "unopposed estrogen" hypothesis, which proposes that endometrial cancer may develop as a result of the mitogenic effects of estrogens, when these are insufficiently counterbalanced by progesterone. In our overall synthesis, we conclude that development of ovarian hyperandrogenism may be a central mechanism relating nutritional lifestyle factors to endometrial cancer risk. In premenopausal women, ovarian hyperandrogenism likely increases risk by inducing chronic anovulation and progesterone deficiency. After the menopause, when progesterone synthesis has ceased altogether, excess weight may continue increasing risk through elevated plasma levels of androgen precursors, increasing estrogen levels through the aromatization of the androgens in adipose tissue. The ovarian androgen excess may be because of an interaction between obesity-related, chronic hyperinsulinemia with genetic factors predisposing to the development of ovarian hyperandrogenism.

Leptin is a hormone with multiple biological actions which is produced predominantly by adipose tissue; in humans, plasma levels correlate with total body fat, and particularly high concentrations occur in obese women. Several actions of leptin, including the stimulation of normal and tumor cell growth, migration and invasion, and enhancement of angiogenesis, suggest that this hormone can promote an aggressive breast cancer phenotype which can be estrogen-independent. This effect may involve activation of the transcription factor NFkappaB. Leptin can also induce aromatase activity, with the potential for the promotion of estrogen production from androstenedione in adipose tissue, and hence the stimulation of estrogen-dependent breast cancer progression. On this basis, we hypothesize that leptin, perhaps in association with insulin, the plasma concentrations of which correlate with those of leptin, has an important role in the known adverse effect of obesity on breast cancer.

An increase in the risk of cancer is one of the consequences of obesity. The predominant cancers associated with obesity have a hormonal base and include breast, prostate, endometrium, colon and gallbladder cancers. As the basis for understanding the problem of obesity has advanced, a number of new ideas have emerged about the relationship of obesity to cancer. The conversion of androstenedione secreted by the adrenal gland into estrone by aromatase in adipose tissue stroma provides an important source of estrogen for the postmenopausal woman. This estrogen may play an important role in the development of endometrial and breast cancer. Of interest is that experimental animals lacking aromatase or the estrogen receptor alpha are obese. Leptin is one of the many products produced by fat cells and has given rise to the ideas that the fat cell is an endocrine cell and that adipose tissue is an endocrine organ. The increased release of cytokines from this tissue may play a role in the inflammatory state that is associated with obesity. The gut also plays an important role in signaling satiety in response to food intake. Colon cancer is an important human disease, and experimental mice lacking gastrin are obese and have an increased risk of developing colon cancer in response to carcinogenic drugs. Efforts to control obesity through preventive strategies and treatment can be expected to have a benefit in reducing the risk of cancer.

Over the past few decades the proportion of people with excess body weight has been increasing in both developed and less developed countries. About 50% of men and 35% of women in Europe are currently estimated to be overweight or obese. In addition to an increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes, the evidence summarised here shows that excess body weight is directly associated with risk of cancer at several organ sites, including colon, breast (in postmenopausal women), endometrium, oesophagus, and kidney. In part, these associations with cancer risk may be explained by alterations in the metabolism of endogenous hormones-including sex steroids, insulin, and insulin-like growth factors-which can lead to distortion of the normal balance between cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Avoidance of weight gain thus seems to be an important factor for cancer prevention.

Epidemiological evidence links breast cancer, a typical endocrine-related tumor, with western lifestyle, in particular eating habits. Yet, it's necessary to distinguish premenopausal from postmenopausal breast cancer. Visceral obesity and body weight gain are considered responsible for the increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. In fact, the mammary gland is sensitive to the level of circulating estrogens, visceral obesity is usually associated with higher levels of free steroid hormones, and the adipose tissue performs important endocrine function (clearance and aromatisation of androgens, regulation of free testoterone/DHEAS molar ratio). Before menopause, ovarian polycystosis is often seen with android obesity, and breast cancer risk could arise; however, as visceral obesity is generally less frequent, genetic factors are more important than nutritional ones. Furthermore, variations have been recorded in the secretion of insulin and insulin-like growth factors, involved in the genesis of the breast cancer. High body weight and male fat distribution negatively influence prognosis of breast cancer, too; this association is linked with the presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors in tumoral cells. Links between diet quality and breast cancer risk are shown: increased use of saturated fats and animal proteins, and a consequently decreased use of vegetables, legumes and fruit, constituting the so-called Mediterranean diet, are considered responsible for the increased risk of breast cancer. Lower fat and alcohol ingestion, the use of dietary fibre and a higher use of complex carbohydrates could reduce breast cancer risk. Finally, starting from the results of our previous animal researches, we suggest using a tryptophan devoid diet for a few days for premenopausal women with male obesity and alterations to the menstrual cycle.

The effects of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in animals are reviewed. In most of the CLA preparations that have been investigated to date for biological activity, two CLA isomers are present in about equal concentrations: cis-9,trans-11 CLA, and trans-10,cis-12 CLA. The occurrence of these isomers in foods and their production by rumen microorganisms are discussed. Potential mechanisms of action as regards the effects of CLA on cancer and body composition are reviewed, including recent evidence that body composition changes are produced by the trans-10,cis-12 CLA isomer. Evidence is presented indicating that CLA may modulate cellular response to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). The mechanistic implications of this finding are considered.

In conclusion, obesity has been associated with increased risk for a number of different types of cancer. The evidence has been most consistent for endometrial cancer, breast cancer in postmenopausal women, and renal cell cancer. More variable results have been reported for colorectal, prostate and pancreatic cancer. Possible mechanisms by which obesity may influence cancer risk include alteration in hormonal patterns, including sex hormones and insulin, and factors such as the distribution of body fat and changes in adiposity at different ages. The increasing prevalence of obesity in many parts of the world emphasizes the importance of learning more about the relationship between obesity and cancer and the mechanisms involved in their interaction.

Being overweight appears to be associated with a higher risk of post-menopausal breast cancer in most studies. Although the relative risk of breast cancer related to Quetelet's index is generally weak (range 1.1-1.9 in the major cohort studies), some studies have found that timing of weight gain and body fat distribution could be more significant factors of an increased risk. Conversely, obesity appears to be slightly correlated with a decreased risk of breast cancer in pre-menopausal women. These contrasting effects of excess weight on breast cancer incidence according to menopausal status, and the lack of a strong association between obesity and breast cancer in some studies, could be due to a number of confounding factors. Among these factors, age, country of origin, family history, alcohol consumption, nutrition, and hormonal treatment could account for the differences observed, and are reviewed in the present study. Obesity and central fat distribution are believed to act through endocrine intermediates such as hyperinsulinaemia and steroid hormones. Since obesity is one of the few breast cancer risk factors that can be modified, the influence of weight loss, particularly in women at high risk, deserves to be further investigated.

This review examines possible protection against various types of tumors from both occupational and leisure-time physical activity. A growing number of well-controlled studies suggest that both hard physical work and an active leisure reduce the overall incidence of cancer. Benefit is demonstrated most clearly for colonic tumors; here, benefit persists after control of the data for body mass index, and a likely mechanism is the speeding of colonic transit, with a resulting decrease in exposure to carcinogens. There are occasional reports of protection against tumors of the breast, reproductive tract, and other body organs. In some of these latter sites, potential mechanisms of protection include a suppression of sex hormone secretion and reduction of body fat depots, where androgens are converted to toxic estrogen derivatives. While vigorous athletic participation may well modulate hormone output, a reduction of body fat is a more likely explanation of any benefit from more moderate physical activity. Protection against cancer is unlikely to become a major argument for an active lifestyle, but it is nevertheless a useful byproduct of physical activity undertaken with other health objectives.

Large-scale studies have demonstrated that obesity increases the risk of developing some forms of cancer. The association between obesity and cancer may result from factors such as fat distribution or sex hormone levels. Studies have also shown a relationship between a high-fat, low-fiber diet and cancer risk. High estrogen levels and low progesterone levels are associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Obesity is known to raise estrogen levels and may lower progesterone levels. Obesity may increase the risk of breast cancer, but the evidence is less clear, since factors, such as age, country of origin, body-fat distribution, and family history, also play a major role in determining breast cancer risk. Sex hormones, insulin, and nutritional factors are also involved in the etiology of breast cancer. The incidence of lung cancer is inversely related to body weight.

Almost all of the epidemiological studies on the consequences of estrogen replacement treatment (ERT) refer to subjects treated with oral conjugated equine estrogens (CEE). These studies suggest that breast cancer (BC) risk is limited and can only be seen after long-term and/or high dosage use. Orally administered estrogens present a number of metabolic and endocrine peculiarities, some of which could be important in reducing the risk to the breast. Actually, these peculiarities are opposite to those observed in post-menopausal women with abdominal obesity (AO), a group which has recently been identified to be at high risk. AO (as other situations in which an increase in BC risk does exist) shows a sex-hormone-binding-globulin (SHBG) level reduction, which causes an increase of both estrogenic and androgenic activity. Further features of AO, possibly involved in BC risk, could be: i) increased free fatty acid (FFA) levels; ii) hyperinsulinemia; iii) increase of circulating insulin-like growth-factor-I (IGF-I) activity. On the contrary oral estrogens, through their hepatocellular effects, cause: i) a clearcut SHBG increase; ii) a trend to reduced circulating IGF-I activity. As a consequence, the possibility that oral estrogens are characterized by a favourable balance between estrogenic activity and biological modifications protective to the breast, is worth consideration. Even non-oral estradiol have a possible protective action through FFA level reduction; however, due to the absence of hepatocellular effect, it does not influence SHBG levels and IGF-I activity. It seems difficult to extend data on the relationship between BC and oral CEE to other types of types of ERT. For the latter, further study will be necessary.

The epidemiology and risk factors for endometrial cancer are reviewed, with current data. Obesity seems to be the main risk factor for this neoplasia, both because it is very common in the female population, and because the other risk factor (i.e. estrogen replacement therapy) has almost disappeared with the addition of progesterone therapy. The pathogenesis of obesity as risk factor, although it is not completely clear and unique, is examined.
